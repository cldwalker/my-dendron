# Td

## Fix '\*' for clojure

2020.11.16 - Only noticed this in past 2-3 weeks

Things to try

- [ ] confirm [vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/fe3ea27178862b7b6474b50f01bb83a7cebd2b61/lib/motion-search.js) isn't source of bug via js console
- Tried changing nonWordCharacters at global and clojure level to no avail
- Flipped scope in config.cson to no avail
  - bg: I noticed clojure package has source.clojure scope while my config has clojure.source scope
